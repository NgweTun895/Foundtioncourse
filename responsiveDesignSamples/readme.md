# Web Design Layouts

- Each example will involve a basic layout with a header, two columns for content, and a footer. We’ll also include media queries where appropriate to make the designs responsive.

### Explanation of Each Layout:

1. Floats and Positioning Only:
   • Uses float to create two columns and position: absolute to position the footer. This layout is less flexible and harder to maintain.
2. Flexbox Only:
   • Utilizes display: flex for the main container to easily manage the layout, making it responsive with a few CSS rules.
3. Grid Only:
   • Employs CSS Grid to create a two-column layout. This method is very powerful for complex grid layouts and is naturally responsive.
4. Bootstrap Only:
   • Leverages Bootstrap’s grid system with classes like col-md-8 and col-md-4 to create a responsive layout easily, using a pre-built framework.
5. All of the Above (Combination):
   • Combines Flexbox for the header, CSS Grid for the main content area, float, and positioning for individual columns, and Bootstrap for the footer, demonstrating how different techniques can be mixed.

- These examples should give you a good understanding of how each method works individually and in combination. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific needs of your project.
