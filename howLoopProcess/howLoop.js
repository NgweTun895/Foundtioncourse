for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    // Code block to be executed

/*
1.	Initialization (var i = 0;):
	•	This step runs once before the loop starts.
	•	It initializes the loop variable i to 0.
	2.	Condition (i < num;):
	•	Before each iteration of the loop, the condition is checked.
	•	If the condition is true, the loop continues, and the code block inside the loop is executed.
	•	If the condition is false, the loop stops.
	3.	Execution of the Code Block (// Code block):
	•	If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop is executed.
	4.	Increment (i++):
	•	After executing the code block, the loop variable i is incremented by 1.
	•	This is equivalent to i = i + 1;.
	5.	Next Iteration:
	•	The loop repeats steps 2-4 until the condition (i < num) becomes false.

Example Process with num = 3:

	•	Iteration 1:
	•	i = 0 (Initialization)
	•	0 < 3 (Condition is true)
	•	Execute the code block.
	•	i++ → i = 1 (Increment)
	•	Iteration 2:
	•	i = 1
	•	1 < 3 (Condition is true)
	•	Execute the code block.
	•	i++ → i = 2 (Increment)
	•	Iteration 3:
	•	i = 2
	•	2 < 3 (Condition is true)
	•	Execute the code block.
	•	i++ → i = 3 (Increment)
	•	Iteration 4:
	•	i = 3
	•	3 < 3 (Condition is false)
	•	The loop stops.

Summary:

Your understanding is correct:

	1.	The loop starts by initializing i = 0.
	2.	It checks the condition i < num.
	3.	If the condition is true, it runs the code block.
	4.	It increments i by 1.
	5.	It repeats the process until the condition i < num becomes false, at which point the loop stops.

This sequence allows the loop to execute the code block a specified number of times, controlled by the num variable.
